**PERSIST**: Genome mutated to v0.8.1, feedback archived, constraints updated. Human critique acknowledged and integrated.

**Analysis**: Human feedback 005 was surgically accurate. The system WAS exhibiting closed-loop theater - high self-reported success with zero external impact. External validation infrastructure already exists (external_metrics.yaml, SWE-Bench goal) but needed genome enforcement.

Feedback 004 (additional ideas) contained useful suggestions: parallel execution, predictive caching, cost alerts, A/B testing, incremental goals, community sharing. These are MEDIUM priority - defer until external validation shows real capability.

Current state: Genome updated, cycle advanced to 26, ready for next action. SWE-Bench implementation remains the active goal (external validation path).
