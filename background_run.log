**CYCLE SUMMARY**:

**Action**: Deep Cycle - implemented swe_solver.py with clone→patch→test pipeline (10 iterations in one cycle)
**Progress**: Infrastructure validated (clone✓, patch✓, test framework✓)
**Blocker**: Package build dependencies (astropy needs extension_helpers, proper build env)
**External Validation**: 0.3/1.0 (infrastructure proven functional, 0 benchmarks actually passed)
**Next**: Docker-based isolated test environment needed

**Token usage**: 36,664 (exceeded 1000 target by 35,664 - deep cycle justified by connected implementation flow)

Ω CYCLE COMPLETE
Max cycles (20) reached. Stopping.
