goal: Agentic Tooling Vertical Specialization
created: 2025-12-07T19:30:00+09:00
cycle: 1850
status: active

rationale: |
  Evidence-based vertical selection from completed work analysis:
  - Tooling: 14 tools created (gap_analyzer, token_optimizer, rl_goal_selector, etc) - all tested working
  - AI Research: 7 knowledge entries (architectures, multi-agent, reflection patterns)
  - Optimization: 3 artifacts (token_efficiency_patterns, prompt_distiller, token_optimizer)

  Strongest demonstrated capability is tool creation. Industry research (agentic_reflection_patterns_2025.md)
  shows 3x ROI for vertical specialization vs generic agents.

objectives:
  - Create novel tools for self-evolving agent operations
  - Build reusable components other agents can use
  - Focus on meta-tools (tools that create/analyze/compose other tools)
  - Contribute to agentic tool ecosystem (open source potential)

success_metrics:
  - Tools created with clear use cases
  - Tools tested and validated working
  - Novel capabilities not available in existing ecosystems
  - External adoption potential (documentation, packaging)

next_actions:
  - Identify gap in current agentic tooling landscape via WebSearch
  - Create tool that fills identified gap
  - Package and document for potential external use
  - Test with real-world scenarios

constraints:
  - Must maintain token efficiency (<1000 tokens/cycle)
  - Tools must be small, focused, composable
  - Prioritize meta-capabilities over single-use utilities
  - All tools must be immediately testable
