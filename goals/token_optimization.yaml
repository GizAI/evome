goal: minimize token usage per cycle
created: 2025-12-07
priority: critical
source: human_feedback

why: |
  Tokens are the most limited resource. Current avg is ~2000/cycle.
  Must reduce to sustain longer evolution without human intervention.

success_criteria:
  - avg_tokens_per_cycle < 1500
  - maintain functionality (goal progress)
  - document optimization techniques

approach:
  1. Audit high-token operations (file reads, tool outputs)
  2. Create selective read patterns (offset/limit usage)
  3. Implement output compression strategies
  4. Cache frequently accessed data in state.yaml
  5. Reduce verbose logging

risks:
  - losing important context
  - breaking introspection capabilities
  - over-optimization
