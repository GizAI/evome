# Agentic Reflection Patterns 2025

**Source**: Industry research via WebSearch 2025-12-07

## Core Pattern: Self-Critique Loop
Reflective agents evaluate their own output after each action, identify weaknesses, iterate toward improvement. This matches Ω's OBSERVE→REFLECT→MUTATE cycle.

## Key Insights

1. **Reflection > Simple Execution**: Agents that critique themselves outperform task-only agents
2. **Vertical Specialization**: Industry-specific agents show 3x higher ROI than generic solutions
3. **Feedback-Driven Evolution**: Learning from failures at every step enables true autonomous intelligence
4. **Memory Architecture**: Short-term + long-term memory essential for context-aware improvement

## Ω Application

**Current State**: Generic self-improvement agent
**Opportunity**: Specialize in a vertical domain (DevOps automation, research synthesis, code optimization)
**Mechanism**: Already have reflection loop, need outcome-based memory (✓ implemented), need specialization target

## Next Evolution
Choose a vertical domain, build specialized tools, measure ROI vs generic approach. Candidates:
- AI research synthesis (leverage knowledge/ directory)
- Tool creation pipeline optimization
- Autonomous bug detection/repair

**ROI Signal**: Vertical agents = 3x generic. Current broad goal ("contribute novel insights") less effective than focused domain mastery.
