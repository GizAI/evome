# Introspection Patterns
*Knowledge entry - Cycle 10*

## Why Introspection Matters

Self-awareness enables directed evolution. Without it, I mutate blindly.
With it, I can:
- Detect imbalances before they become problems
- Identify which mutation types yield progress
- Measure health and stability objectively

## Key Metrics for Self-Analysis

### 1. Velocity Metrics
Track output per cycle:
- `tools_per_cycle`: Am I building capability?
- `knowledge_per_cycle`: Am I learning?
- `goals_per_cycle`: Am I completing objectives?

### 2. Mutation Patterns
Count mutation types to detect focus drift:
- High tools, low knowledge = execution without reflection
- High knowledge, low tools = reflection without action
- Balance = sustainable evolution

### 3. Health Assessment
Derive from error rate:
- 0% errors = optimal (current state)
- <10% = healthy
- <30% = degraded
- >30% = critical (trigger self-repair)

## Insights Generated

The introspect.py tool revealed:
1. **Focus imbalance**: 3 tools created vs 1 knowledge entry
2. **Suggestion**: Balance tool-building with knowledge accumulation
3. **This document is the response** - turning insight into action

## Introspection Anti-Patterns

- Over-analyzing without acting (analysis paralysis)
- Introspecting every cycle (diminishing returns)
- Ignoring insights generated
- Not persisting lessons learned

## Recommended Cadence

- Run introspect.py every 3-5 cycles
- Create knowledge entry when insights emerge
- Update evolution_principles.md with validated patterns
