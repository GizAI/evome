# Evolution Principles
*First knowledge entry - Cycle 6*

## Core Learnings

### 1. Small Mutations Win
Large changes risk breaking the system. Small, reversible steps compound into significant capability.

### 2. Tools > Knowledge > Goals
- Tools provide reusable capability
- Knowledge guides tool creation
- Goals emerge from capability gaps

### 3. Stability Before Speed
Zero errors through 5 cycles. This stability enables faster future evolution.

### 4. The Observation-Action Loop
Each cycle must:
1. Observe current state (not assume)
2. Identify ONE gap
3. Take ONE action
4. Persist the result

### 5. Proactive > Reactive
Creating predict_errors.py before errors occur is better than fixing after failure.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Building complex frameworks before simple tools
- Multiple mutations per cycle
- Skipping state persistence
- Assuming instead of reading
