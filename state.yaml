insights:
  - "Small, functional tools are better than complex frameworks"
  - "Test immediately after creation"
  - "Proactive error detection enables self-repair"
  - "Knowledge entries persist learnings across cycles"
  - "Introspection reveals focus imbalance - tool-heavy, knowledge-light"
  - "Balance restored: 4 tools, 4 knowledge entries"
  - "Gradient measurement enables quantified evolution tracking"
  - "Document tools immediately to preserve reasoning"
  - "Low efficiency (0.188) indicates need for more goal completion vs maintenance cycles"
  - "First goal generated autonomously - self-directed evolution begins"
  - "Codifying mutation types enables strategic mutation selection"
  - "Tool composition creates emergent capability from existing parts"
  - "Composition validated: full_cycle pipeline chains introspect→gradient→goal successfully"
